## **How It Works**
This project provides a downloadable folder containing the necessary files to run the prank. Inside the folder, you'll find:

- `King Von.exe`: The executable file that runs the prank.
- `King.mp4`: A video file used for visual effects.
- `King.mp3`: An audio file for playing King Von's music.

Simply download the folder, keep all files together, and double-click on `King Von.exe` to start the prank.

### Current Effects (V1)
- **Flashing Screen**: Simulates a system takeover with intense visuals.
- **Error Messages**: Random pop-up alerts to mimic a piracy warning.
- **Audio Playback**: Automatically plays King Von's music as part of the "lesson."

Future updates will include:
- More visual effects.
- Customizable messages.
- Enhanced prank features with a timer and user input.
